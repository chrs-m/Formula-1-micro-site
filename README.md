# Code Review

Code review written by [Marcus HÃ¤gerstrand](https://github.com/marcusxyz).

1. `drivers.php:32` - If you want to be more consistent, I would suggest you to add `Team:` for the F1 team attribute.

2. `drivers.php:32` - Not liking my first suggestion? Then maybe you can try to add margin to the bottom. Just to add a little bit of space between team and the driver list attributes.

3. `teams.php:22` - Minor typo fix, it should be `championships`. Might need to change in some other places.

4. `TIP` - In future projects, maybe you could make use of multiple css files just to keep things neat and clean. For instance, have a css file for all your `@keyframes`.
 
5. `TIP` - Adding a `.gitignore` file for all unwanted files in your repo (like .DS_Store).
 
6. Good use of comments throughout your files, makes it super easy to understand what I'm looking at â€“ keep it up!
